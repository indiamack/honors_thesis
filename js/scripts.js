A red flag marks its place for the rough days when water rises and overtakes it again.</p>' + '<p>As the years, hurricanes and tourists pass through Hatteras Island, the shipwreck has dissolved.  The wind and brackish water stripped its deck away, leaving less than 15 percent of its structure. It faded from the island’s memory even faster.</p>' + '<p>Hatteras Island boasts a long list of family names that have persisted since white settlers washed onto its beaches. You can find each name engraved into the 72 small cemeteries clustered beside N.C. Highway 12, printed on fish houses and written on reality advertisements. With generations of family stories to tell, the residents of the six Hatteras Island villages have a deep sense of history. But when it comes to the story of Pappy’s Lane wreck, no one remembers anything.</p>'+ '<p> Its kind of like a car parked on the side of the road,” said Nathan Richards, director of maritime studies at East Carolina University. “When was it parked there? People forget.” Richards has periodically researched the wreck since 2010, but besides the kite surfers dodging its oyster-encrusted frame and a mark on a laminated paper map in the tower of the nearby historic Chicamacomico life saving station, he found little tangible acknowledgement of the wreck on the island.</p>' + '<p>But then the North Carolina Department of Transportation proposed an extension of the Bonner Bridge — the only drivable route linking Hatteras Island to the rest of the state — its steel pillars planned within 100 meters of the wreck. With the ship’s identity unknown, the bridge threatened to damage what could be a site of historical and cultural significance.</p>' + '<img src="'+ path1 +'"/>' + '<h4 class="caption">The new Rodanthe bridge. The white star indicates the location of the Pappys Lane wreck. N.C. DOT. </h4>' +'<p>To minimize the impact of the bridge’s construction, a complete assessment of the wreck was warranted, according to N.C. DOT documents. The assessment, headed by Richards, represented a collision of history and future development. This ship, lying disregarded half in the sound, half in the sun, had a story to tell. One that could impact the infrastructure on an island with its only road frequently cut off by ocean overwash.</p>'+ '<p>With the assistance of the N.C. DOT, the Pappy’s Lane Shipwreck Project began in the summer of 2017 as Richards completed historical research. After examining maps and photographs of the wreck, he turned up a likely candidate, a 19th century vessel.</p>'+ '<p>To confirm his historical research, Richards and a team of nine East Carolina graduate students rose early nearly every fair weather day in September to go to the wreck. They loaded wetsuits, oxygen tanks, scuba masks, buckets, tape measures, diving slates and translucent mylar sheets into trucks. Each morning during the 40-minute drive from the Coastal Studies Institute in Wanchese to Rodanthe, they towed their gear and boats across the Bonner Bridge onto Hatteras Island. The bridge’s replacement ran beside them, interrupting their view of the Pamlico Sound as construction cranes and boats did their work.</p>' + '<p>In Rodanthe, they put their boats in and rode to the wreck a hundred yards off shore. Working in chest-high water, some students strapped on scuba gear to dredge the submerged hull while some stuck with snorkel gear to drawing features of the ship onto the mylar sheets. An interdisciplinary project, microbiologists sometimes joined them to study the microbe communities making their home on the ship, investigating their role in eating the vessel away.</p>' + '<p>It was a tricky ship to study. With the vessel half underwater, both archeologists and microbiologists developed multiple methods for research above and below the water. Even for the outreach portion of the project, John McCord, the CSI director of outreach and education, came to the site prepared to photograph the researchers from three angles: in the water, on the surface and in the air. Underwater photography and drone footage not only connected the public with the project but provided high-resolution aerial photographs and data for a 3-D model that aided in Richards circuitous research.' + '<p>The lack of oral history about the wreck made uncovering its identity even trickier. While there were a handful of accounts from island residents, they conflicted, some saying it belonged to the National Park Service, some saying it was a gravel barge, some saying it was a Great Lakes steamer. Richards specializes in studying abandoned shipwrecks with little historical record, but the Pappy’s Lane mystery was surprisingly difficult to crack.</p>' + '<img src="'+ path3 +'"/>' + '<h4 class="caption">An aerial view of the wreck while the reseach team is at work.

They just knew and remembered it always just being there."</p>' + '<p>Steadily, Richards and his team gathered enough archeological evidence from the wreck to, despite so few initial leads, pin an identity to the discarded artifact, a mystery story in written in the shallow waves finally solved.</p>' + '<p>What the weeks of diving, drawing and mapping ultimately revealed was a surprise to all: The Pappy’s Lane wreck was a World War II gunboat. One that found its way from the turbulence of the Pacific Ocean to its final resting place at the bottom of the shallow, murky Pamlico Sound, forgotten.</p>';

John McCord, CSI.</h4>' + '<h1>The Art and Science of Maritime Archeaology</h1>' + '<p>It may not be surprising to find out that Hatteras island — a tiny spit of land only a few hundred yards at its thinnest — was not always where it is today. At one point, the island resided 50 miles further out to sea. Since its formation, the wind and waves slowly washed sand over the beach and back into its marshes, pushing it slowly inland and keeping its head above the 1 foot of sea level rise per century.</p>' + '<p>While its journey only took decades rather than thousands of years, the Pappy’s Lane shipwreck has traveled a much longer distance than Hatteras Island. But with only a disintegrated oyster-encrusted mass of iron and little historical documentation offering clues, retracing what happened on that journey required a detective.</p>' + '<p>Our detective is Nathan Richards, the director of maritime studies at East Carolina University. An Australian-born and educated maritime archaeologist, Richards came to the Outer Banks an expert in the kind of detective work needed to uncover the wreck’s story. He specializes in identifying abandoned shipwrecks, which are particularly difficult to study.</p>' + '<p>“There is no fanfare associated with their loss,” Richards said. “When ships are discarded, people aren not pulling their hair out and yelling, ‘catch my baby’. There is not hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars at stake. People are throwing away what they think is trash.”</p>' + '<p>When owners discard ships like garbage on the side of the road, there’s usually little to no historical record of them doing so. That means there was no acknowledgement of when the Pappy’s Lane vessel wrecked in local newspapers or government documents. The wreck has even faded from the memory of Hatteras Island residents.</p>' + '<p>Historical research would be key in uncovering what the wreck was and how it got there, but with so little leads, Richards had to get his hands in the Pamlico Sound’s mucky sand and do what he does best — archeological research.</p>' + '<p>Richards led a team of nine ECU graduate students to create a finely-detailed map of the site, which was compared to blueprints from different historical vessels, and excavate parts of the shipwreck. They spent the month of September out on the wreck recording every facet of it, looking for the few tiny, missable details that would ultimately pin a conclusive identity and history to the wreck. They just had to be thorough enough to spot them.</p>' + '<p>Every workday, Richards and his students jumped into chest-high water with wetsuits, scuba masks, waterproof mylar sheets, pens and diving slates. They drew section by section of the site on the mylar sheets while snorkeling and carefully climbing over the oyster-encrusted ship. Within three weeks, they had dozens of drawings. That’s where the jigsaw puzzle of drafting a site map began.</p>' + '<p>The students first worked with a partner to align the sheets for their assigned section of the wreck, carefully taping them together to create a complete picture. Once every individual section had been put together, the real puzzle ― and sometimes debating ― started. In drafting shipwreck site maps, getting details drawn as accurately as possible is extremely important, so when two points don’t perfectly align along the edges of the mylar sheets, debate over whose data point is right can occur. While the process of aligning the mylar sheets was civil for this project, some of the graduate students have seen conflict arise from this process on past projects. </p>' + '<img src="'+ path2 +'"/>' + '<h4 class="caption">The research team transfers their site drawings onto draft paper.John McCord, CSI.</h4>' + '<p>Once all the mylar sheets were aligned and taped down, the light table was turned on, draft paper was rolled out, and tracing was started. For the next couple of hours, six or seven students at a time leaned over the light table with a pencil in one hand and eraser in the other, lightly tracing the lines on the mylar sheets onto the gridded roll of paper. </p>' + '<p>Every once in awhile, the students put their pencils down and turned off the light table to check their progress and evaluate any points of doubts, placing sticky notes on uncertain areas of the map to return to later. They placed their free hands-on strips of paper towel to keep oils from their hands from getting onto the paper and smudging their work.</p>' + '<p>In the end, they stitched together and transposed 177 drawings onto a site map with a scale of 1 foot of the ship to every 1 inch on the map, a high resolution.</p>' + '<p>Unfortunately, a site map wasn’t enough to unmask the wreck’s identity, calling for a unique research opportunity — dredging, a method Richards hasn’t used in a decade. Because dredging uncovers more of the wreck, it is exposed to oxygen and other environmental forces that can lead to corrosion and degradation. Even if researchers rebury the exposed wreck, it may take time for anaerobic conditions to re-establish and stop oxidation, a process that causes the iron to rust and destroys diagnostic information.</p>' + '<img src="'+ path3 +'"/>' + '<h4 class="caption">A ECU graduate students mans the dredge effluent pipe. John McCord, CSI.</h4>' + '<p>The process of dredging requires physical removal of some parts of the wreck to dig further. Because it causes damage, dredging is only undertaken to answer a specific research question and only when meticulous records of activities before and after excavation are made, allowing for later reconstruction. For this project, that research question is simple, yet has proven difficult to answer: What is this ship?</p>' + '<p>The North Carolina Department of Cultural and Natural Resources Underwater Archaeology Branch, which issued one of the permits for the project, mandated dredging of the stern and three cross-sections of the ship. By limiting dredging to targeted areas of the Pappy’s Lane shipwreck based on historical records and an understanding of ship construction, most of the area will remain undisturbed while simultaneously opening up the discovery of new information.</p>' + '<p>After properly anchoring the boat serving as the dredging platform and rolling out the hoses, the research team was ready to jump in the water with scuba gear and turn on the pump. They stayed under the water fanning sediment to the dredge head and slowly moved down through layers of sediment and oyster shell, which periodically stuck in the hose, until the hull was exposed. As the digging continued, they found their smoking gun.</p>' + '<p>“There was a moment in the field when we were about to excavate the stern when we realized what the stern was, which is this sort of flat-bottom tunnel stern,” said Richards. “At that point it became clear that I had a variable that was really important.”</p>' + '<p>“That is what led us to the LCS/LCI identification."</p>' + '<p>Finally, the team had a lead on where the Pappy’s Lane got its start: a class of World War II gunboat.</p>';

John McCord, CSI.</h4>' + '<h1>Shipwreck Preservation</h1>' + '<p>Shallow, brackish water feeds the salt marshes on the sound side of Hatteras Island. The bands of black needle rush and green cordgrass hold in place dark, compact sediment rich in organic matter, the kind that flip flops disappear into. The kind that makes the air smell sulfurous, like rotten eggs, at low tide. The team of archeologists working at the Pappy’s Lane wreck was familiar with that smell and knew why it was there. But sometimes, there’d be something different — something that helped unlock the wreck’s identity.</p>' + '<p>Erin Field’s team smelled it too. As Field, a microbiologist at East Carolina University, and two graduate students drilled out pieces of the ship below the surface, they smelled oil. Once they took those pieces back to the lab to study the vessel’s microbe communities, they found oil contaminating their samples. When she mentioned it to Nathan Richards, head of the archeology team, they discovered that both groups encountered that out-of-place smell.</p>' + '<p>“We both came to that conclusion two different ways and just happened to talk about it,” said Field. This small piece of evidence helped point Richards to a vessel in the historical record: a World War II gunboat turned fuel barge.</p>' + '<p>The field work, historical research and oil smell all lined up. Two names, the LCS(L) 123 and the Hunt Bro. No. 10, finally found their way back to Pappy’s Lane. Mystery solved. </p>' + '<p>But Field wasn’t there to find the wreck’s identity. She and her graduate students, Cody Garrison and Kyra Price, were out on the vessel to study how microbes interact with the ship and possibly contribute to its deterioration, a process called biocorrosion. </p>' + '<p>It was a unique research opportunity. Plenty of light penetrated the shallow water submerging the vessel, so Field knew there’d be an abundance of life to study compared to deep-water wrecks. Most unique, though, was a permit to drill off samples of the ship.</p>' + '<img src="'+ path4 +'"/>' + '<h4 class="caption">Erin Field collects a sample from the wreck. John McCord, CSI.</h4>' + '<p>“Most of the time with shipwrecks, you do not necessarily want to take pieces of the historical wreck away,” said Field.  “So we often will measure things going on with the sediment nearby but not necessarily who is attached to the ship, so it was a really great opportunity to take samples and use them at the lab.”</p>' + '<p>They collected samples of black- and orange-colored metal, signs of biocorrosion, to take back from the lab. There, they scraped off the surface of the metal, where the microbes lived. From there they grew what they wanted to study — iron-oxidixing bacteria. Iron-oxidixing bacteria use iron for energy and make the orange rust on the surface of the wreck. </p>' + '<p>Past studies have suggested they can colonize and encourage biocorrosion, but they’ve never been found attached to a shipwreck. </p>' + '<p>“We know they are in sediments, we know that they are in the water, but we have never shown that they are on shipwrecks,” said Field. “We wanted to quantify those and see if they were there.” Field and her team found them on all of their samples from all across the ship.</p>' + '<p>“It was really exciting because it was the first time that had been shown on a shipwreck," said Field. “There is not lots and lots of them all over the ship. But, just because they are not in high abundance does not mean they are not important. So we think that they work with the rest of their community to have an effect on the fate of the ship. It is one more piece of the puzzle."</p>' + '<p>Understanding the vessel’s varied and specialized microbe communities is one step closer to saving it and others like it from biocorrosion. Only 10 to 15 percent of the Pappy’s Lane wreck remains. With that dissolution, we’ve lost pieces of its story and insights into history. </p>' + '<p>"If we can know that who the microbe community members are, where they tend to be and understand how fast they can degrade, maybe we can use that information to develop preservation methods to protect our shipwrecks," said Field. </p>' + '<p>To develop new preservation methods, it’ll take understanding of how microbes, sediment, seawater and more interact with the ship and intersect with its structure. That means cooperation from chemists to biologists to archeologists to historians. “This is really interdisciplinary work, and I love it for that reason,” said Field.</p>' + '<p>With more than 2000 vessels in the Graveyard of the Atlantic, finding these solutions may save centuries of history from being eaten by microbes, dissolving into the water and cementing into the dark, sulfurous marsh mud.</p>';

Department of Transportation] a lot of challenges in minimizing the impacts to the environment,” said Steve Thompson, the Park Service permit monitor. He worked with other agencies such as the Army Corp of Engineers and the N.C. DOT on over 30 drafts of the permit to balance conservation while maintaining access.</p>' + '<p>To also address the N.C. Highway 12 “hot spots” frequently cut off by ocean overwash, the N.C. DOT originally proposed a 17-mile long bridge from the inlet to Rodanthe.

Dubbed the “jug handle,” plans extends the road from the wildlife refuge out into the sound and then back onto shore in Rodanthe, bypassing the hot spots — and putting steel pillars within 100 meters of the wreck. As part of the mitigation for these bridge projects, N.C.

To maximize the bridge’s lifespan, planners used a 50-year forecast to predict how erosion will move the shoreline over the decades, said Smyre. With an added buffer on the worst-case scenario predictions, the new bridge is longer and taller than the old one.</p>' + '<p>No matter how sturdy the bridge or proactive the policy, the ocean will cut off N.C. Highway 12 again during a not-too-distant future storm, damaging homes and temporarily stranding Hatteras Islanders. But the harsh environment that makes development so challenging is what ties families to the island generation after generation. When asked how long her family has lived there, Kavanaugh responded with a small laugh. “If you go by the genealogy? Since the 1700s.”</p>' + '<p>As one of the few, special places where residents introduce themselves with a handshake and the number of generations their family has lived there, names are as old and sacred as the legends of pirates and lost colonists. O’Neals, Barnetts, Rollinsons, Austins, Midgetts, Midgettes, Jennettes, Odens, Stowes, Burruss and Ballances have been there since their ancestors washed up on the shores of the Graveyard of the Atlantic.

The mix of the two brings sea turtles, right whales and black sea bass to the coast, sustaining a marine ecosystem that makes commercial fishing and tourism and integral part of the state’s economy. Commercial fishing, tourism and recreation make up over 51,000 jobs on shore, according to Oceana, an ocean conservation and advocacy organization.</p>' + '<p>The turbulent oceanic and atmospheric dynamics surrounding the interactions of these cold and warm water currents also gives North Carolina’s coast its centuries-old reputation for being the “Graveyard of the Atlantic.” There are over 5,000 documented shipwrecks in the state’s waters with countless more undiscovered, according to the N.C. Department of Natural and Cultural Resources Underwater Archaeology Branch. </p>' + '<p>These shipwrecks are more than popular diving spots — they represent research essential for monitoring change and managing the state’s valuable natural resources.</p>' + '<p>The wrecks rising high into the water column seem to attract a greater wealth of marine species, from smaller fishes to megafauna like sand tiger sharks, compared to the flatter natural rock bottom.</p>' + '<p>“There is not maybe as much food, but a lot of fish, even in the deep sea, are attracted to structure,” said Steve Ross, a research professor at the University of North Carolina Wilmington Center for Marine Science. “Whether there is food there or not, they are attracted to any complex habitat.”</p>' + '<p>While there are no studies definitively suggesting that wrecks are an improved habitat over natural ones, some wrecks are better than others. Older wrecks generally have a higher cover of invertebrates, which attracts and supports more fishes, said Ross.</p>' + '<p>There’s also a significant contrast from warmer, lighter shallow-water wrecks to the colder, darker deep-water wrecks.</p>' + '<p>“It is a whole different community with almost no shared species,” said Ross. “When you get to the deep sea, it is just a completely different fauna. There is usually less species in the deep sea than in the shallow waters. The whole community is a little bit more simplified.”</p>' + '<p>But that doesn’t mean deep water comes without beauty. On Ross’ research cruises, him and a team of up to 20 other scientists explore wrecks at the dark depths of 600 feet to 2.5 miles. With either submarines or remotely operated vehicles, they count and collect species, encountering swordfish, whales, sharks, and several-thousand-year-old deep-water corals as they do.</p>' + '<p>“I have seen some really beautiful scenes where you are surrounded by complete darkness except for the lights of the submarine,” said Ross. “You light up these coral reefs that just have tons of organisms feeding and food drifting through the water column. They’re as beautiful as shallow-water coral reefs.”</p>' + '<p>No matter the depth, shipwrecks simplify monitoring fish communities. Their recognizable 3-D structure makes them easy to get back to year after year and collect the consistent observations used to evaluate change. Because fish are attracted to them, scientists can also study a more concentrated, diverse group of species than the natural rock surface where they’re more spread out, said Whitfield.</p>' + '<p>The data collected includes the diversity of species, number of individuals, water conditions and time of year, which can be used to monitor the warming effects of climate change on our oceans. During her research, Whitfield saw more warm-water fish than she expected.</p>' + '<p>“We saw species that are not even documented as far north as North Carolina,” said Whitfield. “Pretty soon the ranges of a lot of species are going to need to be rewritten, because they extend much farther north than originally thought. If it continues to become more tropical, we are going to be able to use those shipwrecks as signals of how the ecosystem is changing.”</p>' + '<p>The observations on shipwrecks also translate into the protection of vulnerable habitats. The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council has used Ross’s findings to designate “habitat areas of particular concern,” which stipulate where people can and cannot fish.</p>' + '<p>“A lot of the time, the scientific data is ignored in management,” said Ross. “We have been very fortunate in that the management community has used a lot of our data, so we have been very successful at getting deep-water habitats protected.”</p>' + '<p>Protecting North Carolina’s waters means preserving a remarkable habitat unlike any other in the North Atlantic Ocean. This scene of storms, shoals, war, terror and death where so many ships met their end harbors a significant biological resource beneath the waves.</p>' + '<p>“The fishermen who work off of Cape Hatteras refer to that place in the ocean where the currents meet as ‘The Point’,” said Larry Cahoon, a biological oceanographer and limnologist at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. “That area is really remarkable biologically.”</p>' + '<p>The Point houses at some point in the year 46 out of 47 North Atlantic seabird species, marine mammals and high-value Bluefin tuna — all of which are threatened by human activities such as commercial and recreational fishing, wind farming, mining and the renewed interest in offshore oil drilling, said Cahoon. That threat makes the work done on North Carolina’s shipwrecks — discovering and quantifying the life they support — all the more important.</p>' + '<p>“As these activities move deeper, if we do not know what is there, we do not know whether to protect it or not,” said Ross. “In fact, if we do not know what is there, we do not even know if we have lost anything.”</p>';
var a7 = '<h4 class="caption">A condemned beachfront home in Nags Head. India Mackinson.</h4>' + '<h1>Climate Change and Coastal Infrastructure</h1>' + '<p>Steve Thompson has become familiar with heartbreak in his 20 years on Hatteras Island. In such a dynamic and, at times, unforgiving environment, homes and businesses aren’t promised to stay on their foundation. Rain, flooding, wind and waves have been eating away both soundside marshes and oceanfront beach, along with the structures that occupy them.</p>' + '<p>“I have watched homes start to kneel in the ocean edge,” said Thompson, a National Park Service permit monitor. “I mean literally start to lower themselves into the water on their foundation as it has washed away.”</p>' + '<p>He’s also heard harrowing stories of survival at the island’s most volatile. One friend and his wife stayed in Rodanthe during a hurricane to watch over their beautiful three-story home. Once night fell, the storm surge swallowed up the land and began flooding their house. They ended the night swimming for their lives to the nearest light after their home caught fire.</p>' + '<p>With climate change threatening to increase the intensity and frequency of what causes that heartbreak — storms and sea level rise — residents and property owners will have to reevaluate their relationship with the island’s natural elements.</p>' + '<p>Of course, Hatteras Islanders and decision-makers are long familiar with these disruptions to sunny days in the sand and surf and have incorporated them into infrastructure planning. To address erosion — which is up to 12 feet per year in some places — and ocean overwash, the N.C. Department of Transportation has invested in a new bridge in Rodanthe in addition to an overdue replacement for the Bonner Bridge. </p>' + '<p>These investments represent a commitment to maintain access to the island for the next 50 to 100 years, securing the survival of its tourism-based economy and the longevity of its communities, said Michael Flynn, a coastal advocate at the North Carolina Coastal Federation.  </p>' + '<p>But climate change adds in a new factor to consider. Sea levels are expected to rise one inch per year in the Southeast, according to a 2017 study published by the American Geophysical Union. </p>' + '<p>"The real concern with sea level rise is what that means for storm surge and extreme weather events,” said Aaron Strong, a sustainability scientist at Hamilton College. “You add those extra few inches onto storm surge, and all of a sudden what used to be a once-in-a-generation storm becomes a one-every-few-years storm.”</p>' + '<p>To adapt, Strong said communities have three methods to consider: protection, accommodation and retreat.</p>' + '<p>Protection encompasses physical barriers and shoreline hardening, such as seawalls, to prevent flooding. It also includes beach nourishment projects, which pumps sand onto an eroding beach to widen it. Projects have been implemented throughout the Outer Banks, but with a 5-year lifespan, they’re only a temporary solution.</p>' + '<p>“It’s like putting a Band-Aid on a gushing wound.” said Strong. “It may not be the smartest choice.”</p>' + '<p>Accommodation includes zoning and land usage rules that allow and prepare for flooding. These rules are already in place in most coastal communities, said Spencer Rogers, a coastal engineering specialist with the North Carolina Sea Grant.</p>' + '<p>“The same adaptation actions that we need to be considering for [climate change] are often immediately driven by next year’s hurricane and storm surge,” said Rogers. “Not something that is in the distant future.”</p>' + '<p>Those adaptations include requiring homes to be raised above a certain elevation. Most requirements are based on a 100-year flooding risk, or a 1 percent chance a year the home will be flooded. While those are good annual odds, looking at the entire lifetime of a home is a different story, said Rogers.</p>' + '<p>“If you accumulate that 1 percent per year over 70 years, the risk of the building seeing a flood and getting wet is about 50 percent,” said Rogers. “That is a heads or tails 50-50 chance of the building getting wet if you build it into the middle of the standard.”</p>' + '<p>While 81 percent of the state’s coastal communities require at least a foot of elevation above the minimum standard, more can always be done, which will help residents with both short- and long-term hazards, according to a North Carolina Sea Grant survey.</p>' + '<p>But these investments in protecting structures could create more problems down the road. By encouraging further development in areas vulnerable to climate change, there’ll be more people with more to lose in a storm.</p>' + '<p>The most radical option for coastal communities — retreat — calls for the buyout and abandonment of those areas instead of investing in saving them. But on Hatteras Island, with its villages full of residents whose family names populate the generations-old headstones in roadside cemeteries, could retreat ever be an option?</p>' + '<p>“Retreat is really hard,” said Strong. “Just as we have seen with Florence and with Harvey, people rebuild in those in the same places, even if they know they are going to get hit again, because it is their home.”</p>' + '<p>While all the climate forecasts and economic models may point to retreat being the most sensible option, they don’t consider a far stronger decision-making factor: sense of place, or the emotional relationship and identity associated with a location.</p>' + '<p>“Discounting sense of place and treating people like they are just numbers that can be moved around, that is tough,” said Strong.</p>' + '<p>People with a stake in a coastal town, whether emotional or financial, won’t pick up and leave. To save their homes and neighbors, communities are beginning to take the climate change threat seriously, something that was rare just a decade ago, said Strong.</p>' + '<p>“People are starting to stop debating whether or not climate change is real and instead debating about what to do about it,” said Strong. “They’re realizing climate change is not an environmental problem. It’s actually a local and municipal land use problem.”</p>' + '<p>The first step in managing climate change is connecting information to local governments and conducting a risk and vulnerability assessment. The manifestations of sea level rise are highly localized, making this step essential for every small town to efficiently address it. </p>' + '<p>Next, government decision-making will need to become more flexible and adaptive to meet the unpredictable climate challenges that will arise in the coming decades, which may be easier said than done.</p>' + '<p> “It’s a really long process, which is of course is time that we do not really have,” said Strong. “At the same time, I think there is this narrative that we we are doing nothing about climate change, and we should give up hope. It is simply not true. We are doing lots of things about it in lots of places.”</p>' + '<p>Coastal North Carolina is already stepping up. Dare and Currituck County will be updating their hazard mitigation plans, land use ordinances and building codes in the next year, said Flynn. At a state level, Governor Roy Cooper signed Executive Order No. 80 in October 2018, which commits to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. It also stipulates the integration of climate adaptation and resiliency planning into policy, including the support of risk and vulnerability assessments for any interested communities. </p>' + '<p>“People who live on the island are impacted by nature so much, enough to have an intimate relationship with it,” said Flynn. “They are very environmentally minded and conscious.”</p>' + '<p>Despite the stormy seas and disappearing beaches no doubt on the horizon, this relationship may be what keeps Hatteras Islanders on the map. They understand the value of their pristine beaches on the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, home to sea turtle tests and surf fishing. They understand the value of their expansive Pamlico Sound, home to blue crabs and shipwrecks. They understand the value of the Pea Island Wildlife Refuge, home to seabirds and some of Thompson’s best memories.</p>' + '<p>“When my family comes to visit, we all hop into car, take our binoculars, go down there in the morning and see the birds in the bright sunlight,” said Thompson. “It is a great recreational and educational place.” </p>' + '<p>That’s why they stay through the heartbreak.</p>';
